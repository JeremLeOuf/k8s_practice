# Grafana Integration Options for Your Web App

## Current Situation

You have Grafana running in Kubernetes, but you want it accessible from your CDN app. Here are your options:

## Option 1: AWS Managed Grafana ⭐ (Best for Production)

### What It Is
- Fully managed Grafana service by AWS
- Runs in AWS, accessible via HTTPS
- Native CloudWatch integration
- Professional-grade monitoring

### How to Set Up
```bash
# Add to Terraform
terraform apply

# Get the URL
terraform output grafana_managed_url

# Then link from your app
```

### Embedding in Web App
```html
<!-- Direct link -->
<a href="{{GRAFANA_URL}}" target="_blank">
  📊 Open Monitoring Dashboard
</a>

<!-- Or iframe (if domain allows) -->
<iframe src="{{GRAFANA_URL}}" width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
```

### Pros & Cons
✅ Fully managed  
✅ HTTPS out of the box  
✅ Scalable  
✅ Enterprise features  

❌ Costs ~$10-30/month  
❌ Not in free tier  

---

## Option 2: Self-Hosted on ECS/EC2

### What It Is
- Run Grafana on AWS infrastructure
- You manage it, but it's on AWS
- Use ECS Fargate or EC2

### How to Set Up
I can create the infrastructure for this in Terraform.

### Embedding
Same as Option 1 - works great for embedding!

### Pros & Cons
✅ Full control  
✅ Can use free tier (EC2)  
✅ Customizable  
✅ Learn infrastructure management  

❌ You maintain it  
❌ More setup complexity  

---

## Option 3: Grafana Cloud (Free Tier)

### What It Is
- Grafana's own cloud service
- 10k metrics free forever
- Managed by Grafana Labs

### How to Set Up
1. Sign up at grafana.com
2. Add CloudWatch data source
3. Import your dashboards
4. Get embed URL

### Embedding
```html
<iframe src="https://yourworkspace.grafana.net/..." 
        width="100%" height="800"></iframe>
```

### Pros & Cons
✅ Free tier  
✅ Easy setup  
✅ Can embed  
✅ Works with CloudWatch  

❌ Limited to 10k metrics  
❌ Requires external service  

---

## Option 4: Current Setup (Local Kubectl)

### What It Is
- Grafana in Kubernetes
- Access via port-forward
- Local access only

### Embedding in Web App
```html
<!-- Not embeddable, but you can link -->
<a href="/grafana.html" onclick="window.open('http://localhost:3000', 'grafana', 'width=1200,height=800');">
  📊 Open Dashboard
</a>
```

### Pros & Cons
✅ Free  
✅ Simple  
✅ Already working  
✅ Good for learning  

❌ Requires local kubectl  
❌ Not embeddable in iframe  
❌ Only works locally  

---

## My Recommendation

For your learning project, I suggest **keeping Option 4 for now**, but here's why:

### Why Keep Local Setup
1. **It's working** - No need to change
2. **Free** - No additional costs
3. **Good for practice** - Learn kubectl, k9s
4. **Can still access** - Via the grafana.html page

### When to Upgrade
Consider AWS Managed Grafana when:
- You want to showcase your project publicly
- You need team collaboration
- You're ready for production-grade monitoring
- You want enterprise features

## Quick Access Methods

### Current (Works Now!)
```bash
./scripts/access-grafana.sh
# Or visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### Future (AWS Managed Grafana)
```bash
terraform output grafana_managed_url
# Visit the URL, login, done!
```

## Bottom Line

**For learning Grafana**: Current setup is perfect  
**For embedding in web app**: You have 3 better options above  
**For production**: Use AWS Managed Grafana or Grafana Cloud

Would you like me to implement one of these options? Let me know which one!
