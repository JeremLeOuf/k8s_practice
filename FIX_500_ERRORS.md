# Summary: 500 Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Fixed
1. **Lambda Functions Updated** - Added enhanced error logging
2. **Lambda Permissions Fixed** - Updated to point to correct API Gateway (cryptjyoc1)
3. **API Gateway Deployment Created** - Created prod stage deployment
4. **KMS Permissions Removed** - As requested, removed from IAM policies
5. **Removed Wrong Resources** - Deleted /transactions and /balance from PKB API

### ❌ Still Broken
**CloudFront is pointing to wrong API Gateway!**

CloudFront (d7d0cbcnrfsn.cloudfront.net) is pointing to old API Gateway:
- **Current origin**: mxhswebpjf.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  
- **Should be**: cryptjyoc1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

## Quick Fix

You have two options:

### Option 1: Use API Gateway Directly (Works Now!)
```
https://cryptjyoc1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items
```

### Option 2: Fix CloudFront Origin
Update CloudFront to point to cryptjyoc1 instead of mxhswebpjf.

## Test the API

```bash
# GET items
curl https://cryptjyoc1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items

# POST item  
curl -X POST https://cryptjyoc1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/items \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test","content":"Test content"}'
```

The CloudFront URL will need CloudFront distribution update to work.
